# Against the Cult of Commentary: A Polemic on Theological Method

## Introduction: The Solutions Manual Heresy

**Let's be honest about how most theology gets done.**

You crack open Scripture with one hand and reach for your favorite systematic theology with the other. Not to test the systematic against the text — that would be too Berean. No, you're checking the text against the systematic. You're using the solutions manual to grade the textbook. Or perhaps you don't even have the Bible with you? Perhaps you are just echo-chambering yourself or pretending your favourite theologian is God and your Bible is just Romans 9.

**Congratulations. You've inverted the entire enterprise.**

Here's the diagnostic:

- **Do you quote your favorite theologian like he's channeling divine revelation?** "Well, Calvin says..." "But Owen argues..." "According to Bavinck..."—as if these men didn't explicitly warn against exactly this kind of deference?

- **Have you adorned your shelves with leatherbound systematic theologies you've never actually read?** They look impressive. They signal tribal affiliation. They let you name-drop in arguments. But you couldn't articulate their actual exegetical basis if pressed.

- **Are you an academic who dismisses rigorous biblical work because the author "hasn't engaged the literature"?** Translation: "You didn't cite my guild. You didn't bow to my authorities. Therefore, I don't have to address your argument."

- **Do you treat confessions as inspired writ?** The Westminster Confession, the London Baptist Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism—excellent documents, useful summaries. But when they contradict clear exegesis, which one gives way?

**If you answered yes to any of these, you need to repent.**

Not because studying theology is wrong. Not because learning from the church's wisdom is wrong. Not because confessions and systematic theologies are useless.

**But because you've made them functional substitutes for Scripture.**

You've created a magisterium you claim to reject. You've built a tradition you say you don't have. You've erected gatekeepers between the sheep and the text, and called it "theological maturity."

**Paul addressed this in Corinth. It's called being σαρκικός—fleshly, worldly, immature.**

"I follow Paul." "I follow Apollos." "I follow Cephas."

Swap the names: "I follow Calvin." "I follow Luther." "I follow MacArthur." "I follow Piper."

**Same error. Same diagnosis. Same sin.**

### The Actual Standard

The Bereans weren't commended for checking Paul against rabbinic tradition. They were commended for checking Paul—an **apostle**—against Scripture.

They examined (ἀνακρίνοντες) the Scriptures **daily** to see if Paul's teaching aligned.

**If apostolic teaching required daily scrutiny against the text, what makes your favorite dead theologian immune?**

This isn't anti-intellectualism. This is **sola Scriptura actually applied.**

Scripture is θεόπνευστος—God-breathed. It makes the man of God ἄρτιος (complete) and equips him for πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν (every good work). No exceptions. No supplementation required.

**Tradition is useful. It is not necessary.**

**Confessions summarize. They do not supplement.**

**Theologians explain. They do not authorize.**

When clear exegesis contradicts your tradition, your tradition is wrong. Not the exegesis. Not the text.

**That's what "Reformed and always reforming" actually means.** The church reforms by returning to Scripture, not by entrenching tradition.

### The Real Issue

Here's what actually happens when you present rigorous, text-driven exegesis that contradicts the guild:

**You trace the grammar. You analyze the syntax. You follow the context. You build the case from first principles. You show your work.**

**The response?** "But what does [theologian] say? You can't just ignore [confession]. Have you engaged [systematic theology]?". Have you lost yourself in endless journal articles?

This is the appeal to authority dressed in academic respectability.

**It's not an argument. It's a credentialing check.** You're not being asked to defend your exegesis. You're being asked to prove you've read the right books, cited the right scholars, and genuflected to the right tradition. You're being asked for a commentary on commentaries.

**That's not theology. That's tribalism.**

If my exegesis is wrong, **show me from the text.** Demonstrate where the grammar fails. Prove the context contradicts. Expose the logical fallacy.

**But if your only response is "Calvin disagrees," you haven't engaged my argument. You've just named your pope.**

### What This Polemic Is (and Isn't)

**This is NOT:**
- A call to ignore church history
- An argument against reading theology
- A rejection of confessional orthodoxy
- An endorsement of lone-ranger interpretation
- Anti-intellectualism

**This IS:**
- A defense of Scripture's supreme authority
- A call to test **all** teaching—including tradition—against the text
- An exposure of how "sola Scriptura" gets functionally abandoned
- A challenge to do your own exegetical work
- A polemic against theological gatekeeping

I’m not advocating intellectual arrogance or Lone Exegete Syndrome. The Berean method doesn’t mean you never consult the saints, councils, or confessions — it means you consult them from under the Word, not over it. Acts 15’s Jerusalem council was the right move for apostles during inscripturation; it is not a template that lets later councils trump Scripture. Tradition is a wise advisor; Scripture remains the judge.

### The Charge

**Mathematics doesn't advance by citing famous mathematicians.** It advances by deriving proofs from first principles. You show your work. You demonstrate each step. The conclusion follows necessarily from the axioms, or it doesn't.

**Biblical theology should function the same way.**

The text is the axiom. The grammar and syntax are the operations. The conclusion flows from the evidence.

**If the proof is valid, it stands—regardless of whether Hodge, Bavinck, or Berkhof agree.**

**If the proof is invalid, it falls—regardless of how many footnotes support it.**

**Do the work yourself. Stop being lazy. Stop citing footnotes like it makes you clever**

Learn the languages (or use tools that explain them). Study the grammar. Understand the context. Trace the argument. Let Scripture interpret Scripture.

**Use tradition as a conversation partner, not a court of appeal.**

Read the theologians. Study the confessions. Engage the commentaries. **But test them all against Scripture.**

**And if your only response to rigorous exegesis is "But my favorite theologian says..."—you're not doing theology. You're doing hero worship.**

The Bereans tested **apostles** against Scripture.

**You can test Calvin. You can do it! The Bible is not just TULIP**

---

**What follows is a biblical case for why Scripture alone has final authority, why the Berean method is the model, and why appeals to tradition—however respectable—cannot override clear exegesis.**

**If that offends you, examine whether your offense is with the argument or with the text itself.**

Because the Word of God is ζῶν καὶ ἐνεργὴς—living and active. It cuts. That's its function.

**And sometimes it cuts against our favorite traditions.**

**Sola Scriptura.**

**Actually.**
